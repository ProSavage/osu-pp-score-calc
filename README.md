# osu-pp-score-calc
A Simple WebApp to calculate your pp incase you are banned from osu.
I decided to remedy this problem by creating a osu! score calculator.
So what you're gonna wanna do is, go to the old osu website, and then click the top ranks tab.
(Make sure your osu extensions arent on, and messing with the website)

So, you will be somewhere here: https://osu.ppy.sh/u/10847299#_leader

Then you just want to copy the data like this:

Now you are done!

Once copied, head over to:

https://osu-pp-calc.herokuapp.com/Paste your stuff in, and press submit!

Please star it on github if you can!

Please give me feedback if you guys want more functionality and if you guys like it!
